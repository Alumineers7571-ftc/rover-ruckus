 # Welcome to this garbage fire!
 I'm literally the only programmer on my team so there's no one to check me when I make bad decisions. 
 Please look at this code and steal whatever you want.
 
 # Plans / TODO

 # Maybe
 - Look into splitting MineralSystem into subclasses
 - RobotLib? JDroid shameless promo
